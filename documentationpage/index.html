          <p>
            Windows Terminal is a modern host application for the command-line shells you already love, 
            like Command Prompt, PowerShell, and bash (via Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)). 
            Its main features include multiple tabs, panes, Unicode and UTF-8 character support, 
            a GPU accelerated text rendering engine, and the ability to create your own themes 
            and customize text, colors, backgrounds, and shortcuts.

          <p>Any application that has a command line interface can be run inside Windows Terminal. 
            This includes everything from PowerShell and Command Prompt to Azure Cloud Shell 
            and any WSL distribution such as Ubuntu or Oh-My-Zsh.</p>

            You can configure your Windows Terminal to have a variety of color schemes and settings. 
            To learn how to make your own color scheme, visit the <a href="http://https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/customize-settings/color-schemes">Color schemes page</a>. 
            You can also find custom Terminal configurations in the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/custom-terminal-gallery/powerline-in-powershell">Custom terminal gallery</a>.

          <p>There are a variety of custom commands you can use in Windows Terminal 
            to have it feel more natural to you. If you don't like a particular keyboard shortcut,
             you can change it to whatever you prefer.

            For example, the default shortcut to copy text from the command 
            line is <kbd>ctrl+shift+c</kbd>. You can change this to <kbd>ctrl+1</kbd> or whatever you prefer. 
            To open a new tab, the default shortcut is <kbd>ctrl+shift+t</kbd>, 
            but maybe you want to change this to <kbd>ctrl+2</kbd>. 
            The default shortcut to flip between the tabs you have open is <kbd>ctrl+tab</kbd>, 
            this could be changed to <kbd>ctrl+-</kbd> and used to create a new tab instead.
            
            You can learn about customizing shortcuts on the <a href="http://https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/customize-settings/actions">Actions page</a>.</p>

            As of Windows Terminal version 1.4, the keybindings array has been renamed to 
            actions inside the settings.json file. Support for the keybindings array still 
            exists for backward compatibility, however the terminal will not automatically 
            rename keybindings to actions inside your settings.json file.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can create custom actions inside Windows Terminal that give you control of how
             you interact with the terminal. These actions will automatically be added to the command palette.

            Windows Terminal can display Unicode and UTF-8 characters such as emoji 
            and characters from a variety of languages.
          </p>
          <p>
            Windows Terminal uses the GPU to render its text, thus providing improved performance 
            over the default Windows command line experience.

            You can have background images and gifs inside your Windows Terminal window. 
            Information on how to add background images to your profile can be found on 
            the Profile - Appearance page.

            You can set Windows Terminal to launch in a specific configuration using command line arguments. 
            You can specify which profile to open in a new tab, which folder directory should be selected, 
            open the terminal with split window panes, and choose which tab should be in focus.</p>

<p>For example, to open Windows Terminal from PowerShell with three panes, 
with the left pane running a Command Prompt profile and the right pane split 
between your PowerShell and your default profile running WSL, enter:</p>
          <code>wt -p "Command Prompt" `; split-pane -p "Windows PowerShell" `; split-pane -H wsl.exe;</code>

          <p>First, you'll need to install and enable Git on your local machine.
            Now, open Terminal on your Linux or Mac machine (use Bash on Windows).
            Use the <code>cd</code> command to switch to the directory you want to push to the GitHub repository. 
            Then, start the Git process by typing the following command.</p>
             <code>git init</code>
             <p>Next, you'll make your first commit saying that the git process has been initiated.Next,
               you'll make your first commit saying that the git process has been initiated.</p>
               <code>git commit -m "first commit"</code>
               <p>You've just committed the first Git code locally. Now you'll take it up to your GitHub repo.

                Remember the URL of the project? Insert it in the following command and remember to add 
                <code>.git</code> at the end. Before the URL, you'll also want to enter a nickname for the repository 
                so it becomes easier to push to it in the future.</p>
                <code>git remote add 'project nickname' 'project URL'.git</code>
                <p>Next, see if it worked by using the following command.</p>

                  <code>git remote</code>
                  <p>>
                  You can also use the <code>-v</code> or <code>--verbose </code>command, which will print the URL, so you can verify not only that the remote was created, but also that the URL is correct.
                  
                  You'll see the details of the linked repository.</p>
                  <p>Now, connect the remote repository to the local directory by entering the following command.</p>
                  <code>git pull origin master</code>
                  <p>Now you can push the contents of the directory to the GitHub repository using the following command.</p>
                  <code>git push -u 'project nickname' master</code>
                  <p>This will take all the files and folders from the directory and upload them to the repository. But before it can do that, GitHub needs to authenticate your identity, so you'll need to enter your GitHub username and password. Once the authentication is done, the upload process will start. In a minute or two, you'll see specific details about where the data was uploaded.

                    And that's it: You've successfully pushed your local files and folders to your GitHub repository.</p>
